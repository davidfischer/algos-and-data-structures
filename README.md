Python Algorithms & Data Structures
===================================

The code samples are aimed to learn about algorithms and data structures
and are not implemented because they are particularly efficient in any
sense.

Inspiration for these algorithms came from literateprograms.org,
Python Algorithms by Magnus Lie Hetland and Wikipedia.
